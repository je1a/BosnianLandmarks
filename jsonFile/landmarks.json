It is closest to the town of Travnik, which it overlooks.The average winter temperature is 1 °C (29 °F) while the average summer temperature is 14.2 °C (60.8 °F). In the wintertime snowfall is abundant with an average snow coverage of up to 5 months in accumulation between 1.5 and 2.1 meters. The toponym is derived from vlasi, 'Vlachs', a transhumant people. Academics like Mark Vego believe that the Vlachs, remnant of the Roman Empire, brought one of the trademarks of Vlašić, the Vlašić cheese, in around 1000. It is originally made from fresh sheep milk, but also cow milk, and then left to ripen for two to three months. By perfecting the recipe, the Vlachs passed on the tradition to the cattle breeders from the surrounding mountains. Today, the cheese is produced throughout the area and is regarded one of the traditions of the region. In addition to the cheese, there are two other trademarks, the Tornjak dog and Pramenka sheep. The Tornjak is believed to have existed for more than a millennia, bred to guard from wolves and bears. Its etymology is connected to Neo-Latin torni acca, 'turn here'.",

Most of Igman is covered with mixed forest with local pastures (f.i.: Veliko Polje: Large Field, Malo Polje: Small Field). Igman was the location of the lowest recorded temperature in the region, -43 °C (-45 °F). Igman has been the site of extensive combat during the 1992-95 Siege of Sarajevo and certain areas, in particular the surroundings of former front lines, feature a high mine risk.\nDuring the 1984 Winter Olympics, Igman was, along with Jahorina and Bjelašnica, the location of the competition in the alpine and Nordic sports disciplines. Igman hosted primarily the Nordic disciplines; the Igman Olympic Jumps in the Malo Polje area were the site of the ski jumping events and also the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined events. Meanwhile, the Veliko Polje hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing, and the cross-country skiing part of the Nordic combined event.[2] In preparation of the Games a road was constructed across the Igman plateau connecting Sarajevo through Hadžići to the Malo Polje, Veliko Polje and Babin Dol venues. There were numerous structures constructed on Igman at this time, although many stand destroyed or bear the scars of the 1992-1995 conflict. One of the most eye catching structures remains the Ski Jumping platform at Malo Polje",

Trebević today is important as a tourist destination for citizens of Sarajevo as Igman or Bjelašnica.[citation needed] Most of the land mines are now cleared from heavy fighting that took place in the early 1990s. There are a few hotels, mountaineering homes, and other such structures on Trebević and the immediate area. The mountain is very popular for family picnics, hiking, climbing, mountain biking and it has a downhill track for local and international skiing competitions. Trebević has been the main excursion site for Sarajevo citizens due to the favorable geographical position, climate and the beauty of the nature. The biological diversity is among the highest and it is extraordinary to find such a phenomenon near the heart of the big city.[citation needed] On 9 April 2014, Sarajevo Canton Assembly declared Trebević a protected area, in order to conserve and improve each element of the geographical and biological diversity. Trebević can be reached from Sarajevo by the Trebević Cable Car, which starts from the neighbourhood of Bistrik.",
